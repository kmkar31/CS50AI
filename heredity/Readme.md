<h1>Heredity of GJB2 gene</h1>
<hr>
This Algorithm uses a Bayesian Network to calculate the probability that a person has a particular defective gene given his/her family record of the same.

A person may have 0,1 or 2 copies of this defective gene. Defective genes in a person are either <b>inherited</b> 
or are a result of <b>mutation</b>.
